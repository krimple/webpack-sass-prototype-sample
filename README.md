This sample is taken from the outer project https://github.com/marharyta/webpack-boilerplate.

There were some things that weren't completely correct for dynamic reloading of static HTML pages, 
specifically the settings in webpack.config.js.

I've added some sample content using bootstrap styling.

To setup

```
npm install      ||       yarn install
```

To run (watching JS, SCSS, HTML content for dynamic reloading):

```npm run dev     ||      yarn dev```
